            When English adventurers seized the strategically located town of
            Guînes in 1352, full-scale fighting broke out again. This did not go
            well for the French, as money and enthusiasm for the war ran out and
            state institutions ceased to function. Encouraged by the new pope,
            Innocent VI, negotiations for a permanent peace treaty opened at
            Guînes in early March 1353. These broke down, although a truce was
            again agreed and again not fully observed by either side. In early
            1354 a faction in favour of peace with England gained influence in
            the French king's council.

            The Treaty of Guînes was a draft settlement to end the Hundred
            Years' War, negotiated between England and France and signed at
            Guînes on 6 April 1354. The war had broken out in 1337 and was
            further aggravated in 1340 when the English king, Edward III,
            claimed the French throne. The war went badly for France: the French
            army was heavily defeated at the Battle of Crécy, and the French
            town of Calais was besieged and captured. With both sides exhausted,
            a truce was agreed that, despite being only fitfully observed, was
            repeatedly renewed.....

            It was largely through the exertions of Innocent VI that the Treaty
            of Brétigny (1360) between France and England was brought about.
            During his pontificate, the Byzantine emperor John V Palaeologus
            offered to submit the Greek Orthodox Church to the Roman See in
            return for assistance against John VI Cantacuzenus. The resources at
            the disposal of the Pope, however, were all required for exigencies
            nearer home, and the offer was declined.
